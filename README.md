# Assignment

Usage:
cat input.txt | /path_to_parser/parser.py > output.txt

In case you want to write output to the file rather than redirecting from script output, please uncomment the line "Obj.generateOutput()" and comment the "Obj.printOutputData()" line in parser.py.
In this case command will be "cat input.txt | /path_to_parser/parser.py"
